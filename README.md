# Unity-RollABall
Based on the Roll-a-ball tutorial provided by Unity. Created as part of the membership application for the GameDev McGill club. Includes additional code to solve the tasks issued by the club. From there, the game was heavily customised to fulfil my need for memes.

The "GDM Intro Tutorial Fall 2019" pdf contains the instructions provided to me.

The Roll-a-Ball folder can be imported straight into Unity. Alternatively, see the Build folder inside the Roll-a-ball folder for the executable.
